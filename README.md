# pi_scoreboard
A simple python script for raspberry pi that displays a scoreboard for any given team.
This program scrapes the html of ESPN.com for real time data on a game. It's initialized for the Portland Trail Blazers but can be changed to any team. It's meant to be left running on a small display all the time to always show the current game score. No interaction is nessesary after starting it.
